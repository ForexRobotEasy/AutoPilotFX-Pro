## Features

### Automatic Lot Size Calculation

The EA calculates the ideal lot size based on the trader's desired risk-reward ratio. The `CalculateLotSize` function takes the risk percentage, stop loss in pips, and entry price as inputs and returns the calculated lot size. It considers the account balance and risk amount to determine the appropriate lot size.

### Advanced Trade Management

The EA includes advanced trade management techniques to optimize trade outcomes.

#### Trailing Stop Loss

The `TrailingStopLoss` function tracks the market price and adjusts the stop loss level accordingly. It calculates a new stop loss based on the current price and the trailing stop parameter. If the new stop loss is greater than the previous stop loss, it modifies the order to update the stop loss level.

#### Break-even Functionality

The `BreakEven` function automatically adjusts the stop loss level to the entry price when the trade reaches a predefined profit target. It compares the current price with the entry price and adjusts the stop loss if the profit target is reached.

#### Automated Stop Loss and Take Profit Levels

The `SetStopLossAndTakeProfit` function sets and adjusts the stop loss and take profit levels for all open positions. It iterates through all open orders and modifies the orders to update the stop loss and take profit levels.

### AutoPilotFX Pro Expert Advisor

The `OnTick` function is the main entry point of the EA. It executes the trading logic based on the configured parameters.

1. Calculate the lot size using the `CalculateLotSize` function with the desired risk percentage, stop loss, and entry price.
2. Check if the calculated lot size exceeds the maximum allowed exposure using the `IsLotSizeExcessive` function. If it does, print a warning message and exit.
3. Open a buy trade using the calculated lot size, entry price, stop loss, and take profit levels.
4. If the trade is successfully opened, adjust the stop loss and take profit levels for all open positions using the `SetStopLossAndTakeProfit` function.
5. Apply trailing stop loss by calling the `TrailingStopLoss` function with the ticket number of the opened trade and the trailing stop parameter.
6. Implement break-even functionality by calling the `BreakEven` function with the ticket number of the opened trade and the profit target parameter.
